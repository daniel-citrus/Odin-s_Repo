Pseudocode
(~ -> Action item)

Single operation (e.g. 3 + 4 = 7):
    ~[first] number is inputted

    ~operator is pressed
        -if leftOperand is null
            -number is stored as leftOperand
            -operator is stored
            -clearEntry set to true

    ~[next] number is entered
        -if clearEntry is true
            -clearEntry
            -set clearEntry false
        -number is entered

    ~equals is pressed
        -if clearEntry is true (this means no new number was entered prior to presseing the = button)
            -display leftOperand
            -set clearEntry to false
        -else (this means a number was entered into the input box)
            -clearAllBoxes set to true
            -store number to right operand
            -solve expression
            -store result to previousResult
            -output result

String of operations (e.g. 3 + 4 - 1 * 2, entered in that order = 16):
    ~operator is pressed [instead of equals]
        -solve expression
        -display in log and entry
        -store result in leftOperand
        -set clearEntry to true

    ~[third] number is inputted
    
    ~operator is pressed
        -if leftOperand is not null (this means that a new number was entered)
            -
