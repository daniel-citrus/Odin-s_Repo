Pseudocode

-left and right operands are initially null
-user enters number
-user selects operator (+, -, *, /)
    -left operand is stored in memory
    -operator is stored in memory
    -left operand is ready (next number entry clears entry box)
    -log displays: [left operand] [operator]
-user enters number
    -if left operand is ready
        -clear entry box
    -enter number

-user enters operand
    -if left operand is ready AND entry is not empty
        -store entry to right operand
        -solve the expression
        -set right operand to null

-user enters =
    -if left operand is ready
        -if right operand is null
            -change log to display [left operand] [=]
        -else
            -solve expression
