Pseudocode
(~ -> Action item)

Single operation (e.g. 3 + 4 = 7):
    ~[first] number is inputted

    ~operator is pressed
        -if clearEntry is true (means that the user hasn't entered a new number)
            -update operator
            -store operator
        -else
            -entry is stored as leftOperand
            -operator is stored
            -clearEntry set to true

    ~[next] number is entered
        -if clearEntry is true
            -clearEntry
            -set clearEntry false

    ~equals is pressed
        -if clearEntry is false
            -if leftOperand != null
                -clearAllBoxes set to true
                -store number to rightOperand
                -solve expression
                -store result to leftOperand
                -output result
        -else
            -if rightOperand is not null
                -store entry to leftOperand
                -solve expression
                -display expression to log
                -display result to entry
            -else
                -store entry to leftOperand
                -display leftOperand to log
        -clearAllBoxes is set to true

String of operations (e.g. 3 + 4 - 1 * 2, entered in that order = 16):
    ~operator is pressed [instead of equals]
        -if clearEntry true (update the symbol)
            -display leftOperand with the new operator on log
        -else (rightOperand has been entered to the entry box)
            -if leftOperand is not null
                -store entry to rightOperand
                -solve expression
                -store result to leftOperand
                -display result with operator to log
                -display result in entry
            -else
                -store entry to leftOperand
                -display to log
        -set clearEntry to true

    ~[third] number is inputted
    
    ~operator is pressed
