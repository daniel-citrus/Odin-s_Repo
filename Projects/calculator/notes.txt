Pseudocode
(~ -> Action item)

Single operation (e.g. 3 + 4 = 7):
    ~[first] number is inputted

    ~operator is pressed
        -if clearEntry is true (means that the user hasn't entered a new number)
            -update operator
            -store operator
        -else
            -number is stored as leftOperand
            -operator is stored
            -clearEntry set to true

    ~[next] number is entered
        -if clearEntry is true
            -clearEntry
            -set clearEntry false

    ~equals is pressed
        -if clearEntry is false
            -if leftOperand != null
                -clearAllBoxes set to true
                -store number to right operand
                -solve expression
                -store result to previousResult
                -output result
            -else
                -store entry to leftOperand
                -display leftOperand and = to log
                -set clearEntry to true

String of operations (e.g. 3 + 4 - 1 * 2, entered in that order = 16):
    ~operator is pressed [instead of equals]
        -if leftOperand is not null
            -solve expression
            -display in log and entry
            -store result in leftOperand
            -store operator
            -set clearEntry to true

    ~[third] number is inputted
    
    ~operator is pressed
