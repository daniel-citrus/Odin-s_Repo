        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (8 ounce) skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika </li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces </li>
            <li>⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>4 ounces sliced mushrooms </li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard excess grease from skillet.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and place skillet in the preheated oven.</li>
            <li>Bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in chicken broth while whisking up brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in heavy whipping cream and whisk together until lightly simmering, then reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Return chicken and any juices back into skillet; top with bacon and green onions. Serve immediately, spooning sauce over the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
